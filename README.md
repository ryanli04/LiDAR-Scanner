ðŸ“¡ LiDAR Scanner Project
Overview

This project implements a custom-built LiDAR scanner using the MSP432E401Y microcontroller to map its surroundings. The system combines hardware control, distance measurement, and real-time data visualization to demonstrate LiDAR principles and provide hands-on experience with embedded systems.

It is designed as a student-friendly, low-cost project for learning LiDAR, point cloud generation, and hardware-software integration.

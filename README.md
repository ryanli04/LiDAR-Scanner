A simple 3D scanner utilizing a VL53L1X ToF sensor, a 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor, and a TI MSP-EXP432E401Y microcontroller and an external button. The device communicates distance measurements from ToF to the board via I2C, and send the data to an external PC via
UART. The gathered information is then processed and visualized to 3D mapping via Python.
